#STRAVOSKI

## What it is about
STRAVOSKI is Web client for [Strava](strava.com) users with dedication to alpine skiing. Strava itself is wonderful application but generally targeting to cyclists and runners. Here is an attempt to utilize Strava potential for alpine skiing.
This app works with Strava API and collects activities marked as Alpine Ski. Collected activities are analyzed and lifts are deducted from total distance. Deduction is done on altitude analysis so it may be not really accurate now.  

## Status
App v0.1 is under development now, no live instance so far. 

## Plans
1. Do Alpine Ski normalization based on maps or segments marked as lifts.
1. Import from other trackers like Endomondo
